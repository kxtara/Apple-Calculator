Implement "+,/,*,-,=" operators
   • I have to research an idea I have about the implementation 

   1. if operators are clicked set the firstOperand to eqaul the total.textContent
   2. set the total.textContent to an empty string 
   3. when the 'equal' operand is clicked set the total.textContent to secondOperand
   4. remove '=' from secondOperand
   5. (?) concat firstOperand & secondOperand
   6. disregard (5.) check to see which operator is in firstOperand
   7. remove the operator then make the calculation
   8. set total.textContent to the total

Implement the removal of multiple '.'
